# Cyclistics
Analysis for a bike share company to attract more subscribed riders


# Cyclistic:
A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also oering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8%
of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to
work each day

# About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One
approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and
annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who
purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the
pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be
key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very
good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and
have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs


# Business Task
The company wants to improve her earnings by making their casual riders convert to an annual member. First we have to  understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership. The data used for analysis was the previous 12 months of Cyclistics historical trip data to analyze and identify trends 


# Conclusions and Recommendations
Casual riders are rides more during the weekends using electric bikes while Annual riders use this service as a commute or public transport during the week prefering classic bikes. Now that it has been known how these users differ, it would be recommended to target their marketing strategies to the weekends or electric bikes in order to convert casual riders
