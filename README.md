# Cyclistics
Analysis for a bike share company to attract more subscribed riders

## R was used for this analysis

# Cyclistic:
A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also oering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8%
of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to
work each day

# About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.

# Business Task
The company wants to improve her earnings by making their casual riders convert to an annual member. First we have to  understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership. The data used for analysis was the previous 12 months of Cyclistics historical trip data to analyze and identify trends 


# Conclusions and Recommendations
Casual riders are rides more during the weekends using electric bikes while Annual riders use this service as a commute or public transport during the week prefering classic bikes. Now that it has been known how these users differ, it would be recommended to target their marketing strategies to the weekends or electric bikes in order to convert casual riders
